To run any of the chatbot, run the .py file named after the chatbot model (text-ada-001.py, text-babbage-001.py, text-curie-001.py, text-davinci-003.py)

After the .py is running, open the domain that appears on the console in any web browser (default to http://127.0.0.1:5000 using chrome)

* Keep in mind that the credits of the OpenAI API will expire on June 2023, attempting to run the .py file after that will result in error.
* If wanted to access the language models after June 2023, please repolace the API key (line 26 in each .py file)
